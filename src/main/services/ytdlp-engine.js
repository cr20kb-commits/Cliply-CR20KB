   * notices the client it chose needs a token and fetches one unprompted.
   * That was verified end to end: no player_client passed, and the log still
   * read "Generating a gvs PO Token for web client" followed by a download.
   *
   * yt-dlp's wiki does suggest `mweb` "if you are having issues with the
   * default clients", but that advice is written for someone with no provider
   * at all - the missing token *is* the issue it describes. Pinning a client
   * here would override the one decision yt-dlp keeps in step with youtube,
   * and freeze us on whichever client happened to be right today. If telemetry
   * ever shows the defaults still failing with a provider present, `mweb`
   * becomes a second escalation step rather than the first.
   *
   * three conditions, each of which alone is a reason to stay quiet:
   *   - potEnabled: this install has actually been refused. minting costs
   *     seconds per video and youtube binds a token to the video id, so a new
   *     one is paid for every new video - not something to charge the ~84% who
   *     are never blocked
   *   - potPaths: the payload is installed. missing means degrade to today's
   *     behaviour, never fail
   *   - denoPath: the provider runs its generator on the js runtime we ship.
   *     no runtime, nothing to mint with
   *
   * fetch_pot is deliberately not set: it defaults to `auto`, which is yt-dlp
   * deciding whether the chosen client needs a token for a given context, and
   * that is the part which tracks youtube's rollout.
   *
   * --plugin-dirs is given explicitly rather than relying on a yt-dlp-plugins
   * folder beside the binary. the engine self-updates by replacing its whole
   * directory, so anything parked next to it is deleted by the next update -
   * and the binary itself moves between the bundled copy and the userData one.
