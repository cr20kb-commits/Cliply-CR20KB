cliply started as a small weekend project, just wanted a simple way to grab videos without ads, bloat, or shady sites. it's free, fast, and respects your privacy. no logins, no ads, no cross-site tracking, no bs. it does send a little usage data so we can find bugs, and one click in the Tools menu turns that off — [what it sends, exactly](PRIVACY.md).

> **CR20KB fork:** the `feature/cr20kb-compact-mode` branch adds safe
> post-download H.265 storage profiles. See [CR20KB.md](CR20KB.md) for the
> modification notice and safety guarantees.

## what it is

cliply is a cross-platform video downloader with a nice interface.

currently, you can:

- download videos in multiple qualities (144p to 4k)
- grab audio-only files
- trim clips to specific time ranges

new features are being added regularly. got an idea? request it [here](https://cliply.space/hey)

## setup

**install dependencies**

```bash
npm install && npm run install:renderer
```

**get the yt-dlp engine**

```bash
npm run fetch:ytdlp
```

downloads the official yt-dlp build for your platform into `binaries/`, checksum-verified. no python needed — the app spawns the binary directly and keeps it up to date on its own.

**get ffmpeg (for trimming & conversion)**  
see [docs/binaries](binaries/README.md) for help

**run it locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## building

```bash
# build everything
npm run prepare:full

# create packages
npm run dist

# platform specific
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

## how it works

**frontend:** react + typescript + tailwind → [`src/main/renderer/`](src/main/renderer/)  
**engine:** the electron main process spawns the bundled yt-dlp binary once per operation → [`src/main/services/`](src/main/services/)  
**desktop:** electron handles the app shell → window management, ipc communication, file operations

built with open source tools, depends on [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

## note on yt-dlp

cliply depends on yt-dlp, it's what powers the downloading engine.

we're not affiliated with yt-dlp or youtube-dl in any way. you can check out their [full documentation here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki) if you're curious.
